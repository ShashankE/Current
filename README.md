# Current ~ International Transactions Made Easier.

# Core Technical Implementation

Our Proof of Concept encompasses our customer facing product development by using high speed API's which most accurately show customers how our product will save them money and time compared to a large majority of international wire transfers sponsored by SWIFT banking services. Our product allows for customers to see the entire horizontal process and see the entry and exit price of the transcation be satisfied by the quick transaction times compared to our competitors in te market.

# Architecture 

We used Html, JS, and CSS combined with External API's to support our proof concept. Moving forward we will be adding a VPS SQL Server to host user data and accounts.

# Set-up

To run this code, Simply download the zip file and run "Index.html" on your local machine to access our webpage and product.

# Expected Output

The transcation goes through and the account money is transfered from the crypto balance into the recipents balance in a different currency.

# Accuracy

We ensured accuracy and reliabilty by using high-speed API's which would accurately check the price of our specificlly chosen cryptocurrency. Then increaed reliabilty by using currencies like XLM which have nearly instantaneous withdrawls to a maximum of 1 hour if the blockchain network is congusted. 

# Limiting Factors

One problem we have is that if the blockchain is congusted it increases our liabitity, if the currency begins to go lower than the buy price then it can difficult for us to make a profit off of transcations. To combat this our model will charge a percentage fee depending on the calculated risk factor of the transcation.
